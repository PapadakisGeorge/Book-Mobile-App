        description: 'Philip K. Dick\'s acclaimed cult novel gives us a horrifying glimpse of an alternative world - one where the Allies have lost the Second World War. In this nightmare dystopia the Nazis have taken over New York, the Japanese control California and the African continent is virtually wiped out. In a neutral buffer zone in America that divides the world\'s new rival superpowers, lives the author of an underground bestseller. His book offers a new vision of reality - an alternative theory of world history in which the Axis powers were defeated - giving hope to the disenchanted. Does \'reality\' lie with him, or is his world just one among many others?',
        shortDescription: 'A dazzling speculative novel of \'counterfactual history\' from one of America\'s most highly-regarded science fiction authors, Philip K. Dick\'s The Man in the High Castle includes an introduction by Eric Brown in Penguin Modern Classics.'

         description: 'Franz Kafka\'s final novel tells the haunting tale of a man known only as K. and of his relentless, unavailing struggle with an inscrutable authority in order to gain entrance to the Castle. Although Kafka seemed to consider \'The Castle\' a failure, critics, in wrestling with its enigmatic meaning, have recognized it as one of the great novels of our century.',
         shortDescription: 'Unfinished at Kafka\'s death in 1924, the manuscript of \'The Castle\' was edited for publication by Kafka\'s friend and literary executor, Max Brod. Both Brod\'s edition and the English-language translation of it that was prepared by Willa and Edwin Muir in 1930 have long been considered flawed.'
